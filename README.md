# 15-Mapping-Challenge

This challenge was designed to use leaflet and d3 to map out the data provided to us by the United States Geological Survey on earthquakes around the world.  The code that I created was a combination of the examples provided to us the week 15 module of the UPenn Data science and visualization bootcamp.  With the code used as reference I mapped the locations of the earthquakes with different sized and colored circles to represent magnitude and surface distance.
